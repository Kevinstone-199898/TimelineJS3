## Codebase Patterns
- Script is Python 3, uses requests + BeautifulSoup for scraping, with type annotations in comments (not PEP 526 style)
- Phase files (phase1.json - phase4.json) stored in scripts/ directory alongside the main script
- Output goes to contrib/examples/new_openai_data.json; original openai_data.json must not be touched
- SiliconFlow API (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3) is used instead of OpenAI API for translation (env var: SILICONFLOW_API_KEY)
- py_compile is the typecheck method (no mypy installed)

## 2026-02-18 - US-001
- What was implemented: Verified that scripts/scrape_openai_news.py already fully implements US-001 (fetch subcommand, raw_articles.json output, 1.5s delay, exists warning). Committed the untracked files.
- Files changed: scripts/scrape_openai_news.py (added to git), prd.json, tasks/prd-openai-timeline-scraper.md
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The script uses SILICONFLOW_API_KEY (not OPENAI_API_KEY as the PRD states) — this is the actual implementation choice
  - py_compile is used for typecheck (no mypy/pyflakes installed)
  - All scripts are stored in scripts/ directory; phase files (phase1-4.json) live there too
  - The script uses HTML-comment type annotations (e.g., `# type: (str) -> str`) for Python 2/3 compatibility style
